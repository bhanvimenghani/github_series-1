Hi All I am Bhanvi Menghani an Infomation Technology Under Graduation student passionate about learning new things which will take over the tech space. I have great intrest in doing seemingly hard things besides doing multiple things together. Currently I am trying to get proficient in things I have already learnt and also thinking of restarting my 100 days streak!
Bye!
